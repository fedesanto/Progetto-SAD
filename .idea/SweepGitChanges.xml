        <option value="Refactored ViewController.java to improve code readability and maintainability by standardizing spacing and formatting, renaming method parameters for clarity, and ensuring consistent code style. The changes include proper spacing in conditional statements, alignment of Javadoc comments, and renaming the MouseEvent parameter from 'event' to 'e' in one method for consistency." />
        <option value="Implemented the Visitor design pattern to support shape resizing functionality. Added the VisitorShape interface to define visit methods for Shape1D and Shape2D types (VisitorShape.java). Created VisitorResize.java to provide a concrete visitor that opens JavaFX dialogs for resizing shapes with input validation. Updated shape classes (SegmentShape.java, RectangleShape.java, EllipseShape.java) to implement the accetta method, enabling them to accept visitors. Modified ShapeInterface.java to include the accetta method in the interface. Updated ViewController.java to import VisitorResize for future integration. Also updated module-info.java to export and open the new visitors package. Added uiDesigner.xml for UI component definitions and updated SweepGitChanges.xml with new commit summaries." />
        <option value="Updated the product backlog for Sprint 2 by modifying &quot;Product backlog.docx&quot; to reflect the latest planning and prioritization of tasks. Additionally, updated &quot;SweepGitChanges.xml&quot; to include two new commit summaries that document recent changes, including the addition of the class diagram and a minor refactor in ViewController.java. These updates ensure that both the backlog and commit history are aligned with the current state of the project." />
