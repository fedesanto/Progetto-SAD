        <option value="Implemented functionality to add shapes to the UI. Modified HelloController.java to include a new ScrollPane reference and an addShape() method that creates and adds a shape to the pane using the selected shape creator. Also updated shape selection methods to use enums from Shape1D and Shape2D classes instead of a local enum. Additionally, a file named &quot;Burndown chart.xlsx&quot; was moved or renamed, though it is unrelated to the shape addition functionality." />
        <option value="Implemented drawing mode selection in the application by adding support for choosing different shape types (line, rectangle, ellipse) and configuring their stroke and fill colors. Modified HelloController.java to include new UI elements (ColorPickers) and event handlers for shape selection, as well as internal logic to instantiate the appropriate ShapeCreator based on user input." />
        <option value="Fixed and updated the burndown chart by modifying the Excel file `Burndown_chart.xlsx`. This involved renaming or replacing the file and updating its internal structure, including worksheets, styles, shared strings, and chart data. Key files touched include `xl/workbook.xml`, `xl/worksheets/sheet1.xml`, `xl/worksheets/sheet2.xml`, `xl/charts/chart1.xml`, and `xl/styles.xml`, all of which are essential components of the Excel file that define its layout, data, and visual representation of the burndown chart." />
        <option value="Added a new burndown chart to the project by including the file `burndown_chart.xlsx`. This Excel file contains multiple worksheets, charts, styles, and metadata necessary to visualize project progress over time. Key components include `xl/worksheets/sheet1.xml` and `sheet2.xml` for data representation, `xl/charts/chart1.xml` for the burndown chart visualization, and supporting files like `xl/styles.xml`, `xl/sharedStrings.xml`, and `xl/theme/theme1.xml` for formatting and styling. Additional files such as `xl/tables/table1.xml` and `table2.xml` define structured data tables, while `docProps/core.xml` and `app.xml` store document metadata." />
        <option value="Updated the window title text in the JavaFX application. Modified HelloApplication.java to change the stage title from &quot;Hello everyone!&quot; to &quot;Hello everyoneee!&quot; for UI text adjustment." />
