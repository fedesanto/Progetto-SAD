        <option value="Fixed the pickedFillColor() method in ViewController.java to ensure that fill color is only applied to 2D shapes. This was done by adding a type check to confirm the selected shape is an instance of Shape2DCreator before setting the fill color, preventing potential runtime errors for unsupported shape types. Additionally, SweepGitChanges.xml was updated to include a new commit summary documenting the removal of redundant enumerator classes, maintaining accurate version control metadata." />
        <option value="Removed redundant enumerator classes TYPE_1D.java and TYPE_2D.java to eliminate duplication and streamline shape type definitions. These enums were previously used to distinguish between different 1D and 2D shapes (e.g., LINE, RECTANGLE, ELLIPSE) but have now been removed, likely due to their functionality being integrated elsewhere or deemed unnecessary. SweepGitChanges.xml was updated to reflect this change by adding a new commit summary describing the removal of these enums, ensuring accurate version control metadata." />
        <option value="Added toString() method declarations to Shape1D.java and Shape2D.java interfaces to support standardized string representations of shape objects. This change enhances debugging and logging capabilities by ensuring that all implementing classes provide a textual description of their state." />
        <option value="Added enumerations to shape interfaces to define specific shape types. Introduced TYPE_2D enum in Shape2D.java to represent RECTANGLE and ELLIPSE, and TYPE_1D enum in Shape1D.java to represent LINE, enabling clearer type distinction for 1D and 2D shapes. Updated SweepGitChanges.xml to include a new commit summary reflecting recent changes, supporting IDE tooling and version control metadata." />
        <option value="Merged functionality from HelloController into ViewController to consolidate UI logic for shape creation and color selection. The HelloController.java file was deleted, and its methods and fields were migrated to ViewController.java, including handlers for selecting shape types (line, rectangle, ellipse), updating stroke and fill colors, and adding shapes to the UI pane. SweepGitChanges.xml was updated to include a new commit summary reflecting this merge. GhostTextManager_v2.xml was updated to track ghost text metadata for the addShape() method, indicating IDE tooling support for code suggestions or completions." />
        <option value="Resolved merge conflict in HelloController.java during integration of remote changes from the 'master' branch. The file HelloController.java was modified to address a minor formatting issue (addition of a blank line) likely introduced during conflict resolution." />
        <option value="Added two XML configuration files to persist IDE metadata. SweepGitChanges.xml was created to store recent commit summaries, likely for integration with a version control plugin or tool. GhostTextManager_v2.xml was added to track ghost text input metadata, specifically for enum type declarations, including usage count and timestamps. These files support development tooling and do not directly affect application logic." />
        <option value="Added functionality to update the stroke and fill colors of shapes in the UI. Modified HelloController.java to include new event handler methods pickedStrokeColor() and pickedFillColor(), which apply the selected colors to the currently selected shape. Also updated the addShape() method to correctly add new shapes to the pane's content." />
        <option value="Implemented functionality to add shapes to the UI. Modified HelloController.java to include a new ScrollPane reference and an addShape() method that creates and adds a shape to the pane using the selected shape creator. Also updated shape selection methods to use enums from Shape1D and Shape2D classes instead of a local enum. Additionally, a file named &quot;Burndown chart.xlsx&quot; was moved or renamed, though it is unrelated to the shape addition functionality." />
        <option value="Implemented drawing mode selection in the application by adding support for choosing different shape types (line, rectangle, ellipse) and configuring their stroke and fill colors. Modified HelloController.java to include new UI elements (ColorPickers) and event handlers for shape selection, as well as internal logic to instantiate the appropriate ShapeCreator based on user input." />
