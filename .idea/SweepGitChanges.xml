        <option value="Updated the Burndown chart to reflect the current task progress. The file &quot;Burndown chart.xlsx&quot; was modified to incorporate the latest project status, likely including updated task completion data and visualizations. Additionally, &quot;SweepGitChanges.xml&quot; was updated to include a new commit summary entry documenting recent enhancements related to JavaDoc comments and user alerts, ensuring accurate version tracking and historical context." />
        <option value="Added JavaDoc comments and user alerts to improve code clarity and user feedback. In ViewController.java, added detailed JavaDoc for key methods (e.g., shape highlighting, file operations) and implemented error alerts for failed save/load operations. In FileManager.java, documented the expected file format and added JavaDoc for saveFile and loadFile methods to clarify their behavior. SweepGitChanges.xml was updated to include a new commit summary reflecting these enhancements." />
        <option value="Implemented functionality to disable the &quot;Save&quot; menu item when the workspace is empty. Modified ViewController.java to add a new handler method (onClickFile) that checks if the workspace has any children and disables the saveButton accordingly. Also added a reference to the saveButton MenuItem via @FXML. Updated view.fxml to bind the &quot;File&quot; menu's onShowing event to the new handler and assigned an fx:id to the &quot;Salva&quot; MenuItem to enable programmatic access." />
        <option value="Fixed bugs related to saving and loading shapes. In `ViewController.java`, added null checks for `chosenShape` to prevent runtime errors when setting stroke and fill colors, and corrected file validation logic to check for null instead of relying on file extension. Removed unnecessary error messages. In `view.fxml`, connected the &quot;Salva&quot; and &quot;Carica&quot; menu items to their respective controller methods via `onAction` attributes. In `FileManager.java`, corrected shape type string from &quot;Ellipse&quot; to &quot;EllipseShape&quot; to ensure proper deserialization during file loading." />
        <option value="Updated SweepGitChanges.xml to include a new commit summary documenting recent changes to FileManager.java, Shape2DCreator.java, and Shape2DCreatorTest.java. These changes involved replacing deprecated setCenterX/Y methods with setShapeX/Y in FileManager.java for compatibility with the updated ShapeInterface, improving null and type safety in Shape2DCreator.java by replacing a switch statement with if-else logic, and adjusting Shape2DCreatorTest.java to reflect new default shape dimensions. SweepGitChanges.xml was modified to maintain an accurate history of these updates." />
        <option value="Updated FileManager.java to replace deprecated setCenterX/Y calls with setShapeX/Y for compatibility with the updated ShapeInterface. Modified Shape2DCreator.java to handle null or unexpected shape types more safely by replacing the switch statement with if-else logic. Adjusted Shape2DCreatorTest.java to reflect new default shape dimensions (width: 80, height: 50). Also updated SweepGitChanges.xml to include new commit summaries documenting these changes." />
        <option value="Resolved merge conflicts in ViewController.java by standardizing variable names and aligning method calls with updated ShapeInterface API. Specifically, renamed method parameters from 'chosenShape' to 'shape' for clarity and consistency, and updated method calls from setCenterX/Y to setShapeX/Y to reflect interface changes. The ViewController.java file was the only file modified, as it handles user interactions and shape highlighting logic in the application." />
        <option value="Implemented file save and load functionality for shape data. Modified FileManager.java to add saveFile and loadFile methods that serialize and deserialize shape objects to and from .txt files. Updated ViewController.java to integrate these file operations via new event handlers (saveFileOperation and loadFileOperation), allowing users to persist and restore workspace shapes. Also refactored variable names for clarity (e.g., selectedShape to chosenShape). Updated SweepGitChanges.xml to include new commit summaries reflecting recent changes." />
        <option value="Updated default dimensions for 2D shapes by modifying the constants in Shape2DCreator.java, increasing the default width from 30 to 80 and height from 20 to 50 to improve shape visibility or layout consistency. Also updated SweepGitChanges.xml to include a new commit summary reflecting this change and maintain accurate development history." />
