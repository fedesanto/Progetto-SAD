        <option value="Added the retrospective report for Sprint 2 by including the file &quot;Retrospective Report Sprint 2.xlsx&quot;. This Excel file contains the documented feedback and analysis from the second sprint. The commit also includes associated metadata and configuration files automatically generated by Excel, such as workbook structure (xl/workbook.xml), worksheet data (xl/worksheets/sheet1.xml), styles (xl/styles.xml), shared strings (xl/sharedStrings.xml), and custom XML properties (customXml/*), which support the content and formatting of the spreadsheet." />
        <option value="Updated some acceptance criteria in the Product Backlog. The main file modified was `Product backlog.docx`, which contains the backlog items and their associated acceptance criteria. The changes likely reflect refinements or clarifications to existing backlog items. No other files were relevant to this task." />
        <option value="Updated inline comments in the addShapeEvents method within ViewController.java to clarify the behavior of shape selection and dragging. These changes improve code readability by explaining when shapes are selected and how drag offsets are calculated. Only ViewController.java was modified as it contains the relevant event handling logic." />
        <option value="Added and updated inline comments in the addShapeEvents method within ViewController.java to clarify the logic for shape selection and drag initialization. These changes improve code readability by explaining when shapes are selected and how drag offsets are calculated. Only ViewController.java was modified as it contains the relevant event handling logic." />

        <option value="Added the clone() method to the ShapeInterface and implemented it in RectangleShape, EllipseShape, and SegmentShape classes. This allows each shape to return a deep copy of itself with identical attributes. The ShapeInterface.java file was updated to declare the new method, while RectangleShape.java, EllipseShape.java, and SegmentShape.java were modified to provide concrete implementations of the clone() method for their respective shape types." />
        <option value="Added &quot;Copy&quot; and &quot;Cut&quot; options to the context menu for shapes in the application. Modified `ViewController.java` to implement the new menu items, enabling users to duplicate or remove selected shapes from the workspace. Introduced a `copiedShape` field to store the cloned shape for later use. Also updated `SweepGitChanges.xml` to include a new commit summary documenting these changes, ensuring the commit history reflects the latest UI enhancements." />
        <option value="Updated the burndown chart to reflect the latest sprint progress. Modified `Burndown chart.xlsx` to include updated data and visualizations tracking task completion over time. Additionally, updated `SweepGitChanges.xml` to add a new commit summary documenting recent changes related to sprint planning and segment shape refactoring, ensuring the commit history remains aligned with project updates." />
