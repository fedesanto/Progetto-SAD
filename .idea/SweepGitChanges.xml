        <option value="Groomed the product backlog for Sprint 2 by updating the &quot;Product backlog.docx&quot; file to reflect the latest planning and prioritization of tasks. Additionally, modified &quot;SweepGitChanges.xml&quot; to include new commit summaries that document recent changes, including the addition of the class diagram and retrospective report, as well as minor refactoring in ViewController.java. These updates ensure that both the backlog and commit history are aligned with the current state of the project." />
        <option value="Groomed the product backlog for Sprint 2 by updating the &quot;Product backlog.docx&quot; file to reflect new or revised backlog items. Additionally, modified &quot;SweepGitChanges.xml&quot; to include two new commit summaries documenting recent additions: the inclusion of the class diagram for Sprint 1 and a minor refactor in ViewController.java. These updates ensure the backlog and commit history are aligned with the current state of the project." />
        <option value="Added the file &quot;Class Diagram Sprint 1.pdf&quot; to the project to document the class structure and relationships defined during Sprint 1. This file serves as a visual representation of the system's design and architecture at this stage of development. Additionally, updated SweepGitChanges.xml to include a new commit summary reflecting the addition of the class diagram. Minor refactoring was also performed in ViewController.java to improve code readability by renaming a method parameter from 'e' to 'event' and updating corresponding references." />
        <option value="Added the file &quot;Class Diagram Sprint 1.pdf&quot; to document the class structure for Sprint 1, supporting project design and architecture planning. Also updated SweepGitChanges.xml to include a new commit summary reflecting the addition of the retrospective report and recent documentation updates. Additionally, made a minor refactor in ViewController.java by renaming a method parameter from 'e' to 'event' for clarity and consistency in the chosenEllipse method." />
        <option value="Added the retrospective report for Sprint 1 to the project. The new file Retrospective Report Sprint 1.xlsx was introduced to document the team's reflections, lessons learned, and improvement plans for the sprint. Additionally, SweepGitChanges.xml was updated to include new commit summaries that reflect recent changes, ensuring the commit history remains accurate and up to date." />
        <option value="Updated mouse click handling to restrict shape selection to left-clicks and refreshed project documentation. Modified ViewController.java to ensure shape selection (line, rectangle, ellipse) only occurs on primary mouse button clicks, improving user interaction reliability. Updated SweepGitChanges.xml to include new commit summaries reflecting recent changes. Replaced Burndown chart.xlsx and Review Report Sprint 1.docx with updated versions to reflect current project progress and sprint review documentation." />
        <option value="Improved mouse click handling and updated project documentation. In ViewController.java, added checks to ensure shape selection and creation only occur on primary (left) mouse button clicks, enhancing user interaction reliability. Updated SweepGitChanges.xml to include new commit summaries reflecting recent changes. Modified Burndown chart.xlsx to reflect current task progress and added a new document Review Report Sprint 1.docx to document the sprint review outcomes." />
        <option value="Restricted file loading to only accept .txt files and improved error handling in ViewController.java. Updated the file chooser filters to correctly use &quot;*.txt&quot; instead of &quot;.txt&quot;, added a check to ensure only .txt files can be loaded, and refactored repeated alert code into a reusable showAlert method for better maintainability. SweepGitChanges.xml was updated to include a new commit summary reflecting these enhancements." />

        <option value="Updated the Burndown chart to reflect the current task progress. The file &quot;Burndown chart.xlsx&quot; was modified to incorporate the latest project status, likely including updated task completion data and visualizations. Additionally, &quot;SweepGitChanges.xml&quot; was updated to include a new commit summary entry documenting recent enhancements related to JavaDoc comments and user alerts, ensuring accurate version tracking and historical context." />
