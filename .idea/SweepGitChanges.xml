        <option value="Refactored variable names related to drag offset in ViewController.java to improve clarity, renaming `startDragX` and `startDragY` to `dragOffsetX` and `dragOffsetY`. This change enhances code readability by better reflecting their purpose in shape dragging logic. Additionally, fixed a bug in the shape loading process by ensuring that event handlers are reattached to each shape after loading from file. Also updated SweepGitChanges.xml to include a new commit summary documenting the addition of the Sprint 2 retrospective report, maintaining an accurate project history." />

        <option value="Added the retrospective report for Sprint 2 by including the file &quot;Retrospective Report Sprint 2.xlsx&quot;. This Excel file contains the documented feedback and analysis from the second sprint. The commit also includes associated metadata and configuration files automatically generated by Excel, such as workbook structure (xl/workbook.xml), worksheet data (xl/worksheets/sheet1.xml), styles (xl/styles.xml), shared strings (xl/sharedStrings.xml), and custom XML properties (customXml/*), which support the content and formatting of the spreadsheet." />
        <option value="Updated some acceptance criteria in the Product Backlog. The main file modified was `Product backlog.docx`, which contains the backlog items and their associated acceptance criteria. The changes likely reflect refinements or clarifications to existing backlog items. No other files were relevant to this task." />
        <option value="Updated inline comments in the addShapeEvents method within ViewController.java to clarify the behavior of shape selection and dragging. These changes improve code readability by explaining when shapes are selected and how drag offsets are calculated. Only ViewController.java was modified as it contains the relevant event handling logic." />
        <option value="Added and updated inline comments in the addShapeEvents method within ViewController.java to clarify the logic for shape selection and drag initialization. These changes improve code readability by explaining when shapes are selected and how drag offsets are calculated. Only ViewController.java was modified as it contains the relevant event handling logic." />
