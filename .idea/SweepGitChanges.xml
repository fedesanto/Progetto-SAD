        <option value="Added a default stroke width for segment shapes to improve visual consistency. Updated `SegmentShape.java` to include a new `strokeWidth` parameter in the constructor and applied it using `setStrokeWidth`. Modified `Shape1DCreator.java` to define a constant `D1_STROKE_WIDTH` and pass it when creating `SegmentShape` instances. Adjusted `SegmentShapeTest.java` to reflect the updated constructor by providing the stroke width in test setup. Finally, updated `SweepGitChanges.xml` to include a new commit summary documenting these changes." />
        <option value="Renamed an attribute and a method to improve code clarity and consistency. In ViewController.java, the attribute 'selectedShape' was renamed to 'menuShape' to better reflect its role in context menu interactions, and the method 'addShape' was renamed to 'clickOnWorkspace' to more accurately describe its event handling purpose. Correspondingly, view.fxml was updated to reference the renamed method in the onMouseClicked handler for the workspace." />
        <option value="Implemented a context menu with a &quot;Delete&quot; option for shapes and updated the UI to use buttons for shape selection. Modified `ViewController.java` to add context menu logic, handle right-click events on shapes, and replace shape highlighting with button highlighting. Updated `view.fxml` to replace direct shape elements with buttons containing shape graphics, improving user interaction and visual feedback." />
        <option value="Renamed Visitor pattern method names from Italian to English to improve code clarity and maintain consistency across the codebase. Specifically, the method `visita` was renamed to `visit`, and `accetta` to `accept`. This change affected multiple files: `VisitorShape.java` and `VisitorResize.java` were updated to reflect the new method names in the interface and implementation; `RectangleShape.java`, `EllipseShape.java`, and `SegmentShape.java` were modified to use `accept(visitor)` instead of `accetta(visitor)`; `ShapeInterface.java` was updated to declare `accept(VisitorShape visitor)`; and `SweepGitChanges.xml` was updated to include a new commit summary documenting these changes." />
        <option value="Refactored ViewController.java to improve code readability and maintainability by standardizing spacing and formatting, renaming method parameters for clarity, and ensuring consistent code style. The changes include proper spacing in conditional statements, alignment of Javadoc comments, and renaming the MouseEvent parameter from 'event' to 'e' in one method for consistency." />
        <option value="Implemented the Visitor design pattern to support shape resizing functionality. Added the VisitorShape interface to define visit methods for Shape1D and Shape2D types (VisitorShape.java). Created VisitorResize.java to provide a concrete visitor that opens JavaFX dialogs for resizing shapes with input validation. Updated shape classes (SegmentShape.java, RectangleShape.java, EllipseShape.java) to implement the accetta method, enabling them to accept visitors. Modified ShapeInterface.java to include the accetta method in the interface. Updated ViewController.java to import VisitorResize for future integration. Also updated module-info.java to export and open the new visitors package. Added uiDesigner.xml for UI component definitions and updated SweepGitChanges.xml with new commit summaries." />
        <option value="Updated the product backlog for Sprint 2 by modifying &quot;Product backlog.docx&quot; to reflect the latest planning and prioritization of tasks. Additionally, updated &quot;SweepGitChanges.xml&quot; to include two new commit summaries that document recent changes, including the addition of the class diagram and a minor refactor in ViewController.java. These updates ensure that both the backlog and commit history are aligned with the current state of the project." />

        <option value="Groomed the product backlog for Sprint 2 by updating the &quot;Product backlog.docx&quot; file to reflect the latest planning and prioritization of tasks.
