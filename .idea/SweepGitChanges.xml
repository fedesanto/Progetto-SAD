        <option value="Refactored shape interfaces and implemented the SegmentShape class with corresponding unit tests. The old abstract SegmentShape class was removed and replaced with a concrete implementation in shapes/SegmentShape.java, which extends JavaFX's Line and implements the new Shape1D interface. SegmentShapeTest.java was added to validate its behavior. The Shape1D and Shape2D interfaces were moved to the shapes package and simplified. ShapeInterface was also moved and updated accordingly. Several files were renamed and reorganized into appropriate packages (e.g., UI, factories, fileHandlers) to improve modularity. ViewController.java and DrawingApplication.java were updated to reflect the new package structure. The module-info.java and pom.xml files were modified to export and open the new packages." />
        <option value="Removed an unused import of ScrollPane from ViewController.java to clean up the code and eliminate unnecessary dependencies. Also updated SweepGitChanges.xml to include a new commit summary documenting recent UI refactoring and metadata changes, maintaining accurate version control history." />
        <option value="Refactored the UI layout management by replacing the ScrollPane reference with a direct Pane reference in ViewController.java to simplify shape rendering and interaction. Updated the addShape() method to add shapes directly to the Pane instead of accessing the ScrollPane's content. Also removed an unused Label import. Modified SweepGitChanges.xml to include a new commit summary documenting a related fix to fill color application logic and metadata updates." />
        <option value="Fixed the pickedFillColor() method in ViewController.java to ensure that fill color is only applied to 2D shapes. This was done by adding a type check to confirm the selected shape is an instance of Shape2DCreator before setting the fill color, preventing potential runtime errors for unsupported shape types. Additionally, SweepGitChanges.xml was updated to include a new commit summary documenting the removal of redundant enumerator classes, maintaining accurate version control metadata." />
        <option value="Removed redundant enumerator classes TYPE_1D.java and TYPE_2D.java to eliminate duplication and streamline shape type definitions. These enums were previously used to distinguish between different 1D and 2D shapes (e.g., LINE, RECTANGLE, ELLIPSE) but have now been removed, likely due to their functionality being integrated elsewhere or deemed unnecessary. SweepGitChanges.xml was updated to reflect this change by adding a new commit summary describing the removal of these enums, ensuring accurate version control metadata." />
        <option value="Added toString() method declarations to Shape1D.java and Shape2D.java interfaces to support standardized string representations of shape objects. This change enhances debugging and logging capabilities by ensuring that all implementing classes provide a textual description of their state." />
        <option value="Added enumerations to shape interfaces to define specific shape types. Introduced TYPE_2D enum in Shape2D.java to represent RECTANGLE and ELLIPSE, and TYPE_1D enum in Shape1D.java to represent LINE, enabling clearer type distinction for 1D and 2D shapes. Updated SweepGitChanges.xml to include a new commit summary reflecting recent changes, supporting IDE tooling and version control metadata." />
        <option value="Merged functionality from HelloController into ViewController to consolidate UI logic for shape creation and color selection. The HelloController.java file was deleted, and its methods and fields were migrated to ViewController.java, including handlers for selecting shape types (line, rectangle, ellipse), updating stroke and fill colors, and adding shapes to the UI pane. SweepGitChanges.xml was updated to include a new commit summary reflecting this merge. GhostTextManager_v2.xml was updated to track ghost text metadata for the addShape() method, indicating IDE tooling support for code suggestions or completions." />
        <option value="Resolved merge conflict in HelloController.java during integration of remote changes from the 'master' branch. The file HelloController.java was modified to address a minor formatting issue (addition of a blank line) likely introduced during conflict resolution." />
        <option value="Added two XML configuration files to persist IDE metadata. SweepGitChanges.xml was created to store recent commit summaries, likely for integration with a version control plugin or tool. GhostTextManager_v2.xml was added to track ghost text input metadata, specifically for enum type declarations, including usage count and timestamps. These files support development tooling and do not directly affect application logic." />
