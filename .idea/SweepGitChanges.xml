        <option value="Updated FileManager.java to replace deprecated setCenterX/Y calls with setShapeX/Y for compatibility with the updated ShapeInterface. Modified Shape2DCreator.java to handle null or unexpected shape types more safely by replacing the switch statement with if-else logic. Adjusted Shape2DCreatorTest.java to reflect new default shape dimensions (width: 80, height: 50). Also updated SweepGitChanges.xml to include new commit summaries documenting these changes." />
        <option value="Resolved merge conflicts in ViewController.java by standardizing variable names and aligning method calls with updated ShapeInterface API. Specifically, renamed method parameters from 'chosenShape' to 'shape' for clarity and consistency, and updated method calls from setCenterX/Y to setShapeX/Y to reflect interface changes. The ViewController.java file was the only file modified, as it handles user interactions and shape highlighting logic in the application." />
        <option value="Implemented file save and load functionality for shape data. Modified FileManager.java to add saveFile and loadFile methods that serialize and deserialize shape objects to and from .txt files. Updated ViewController.java to integrate these file operations via new event handlers (saveFileOperation and loadFileOperation), allowing users to persist and restore workspace shapes. Also refactored variable names for clarity (e.g., selectedShape to chosenShape). Updated SweepGitChanges.xml to include new commit summaries reflecting recent changes." />
        <option value="Updated default dimensions for 2D shapes by modifying the constants in Shape2DCreator.java, increasing the default width from 30 to 80 and height from 20 to 50 to improve shape visibility or layout consistency. Also updated SweepGitChanges.xml to include a new commit summary reflecting this change and maintain accurate development history." />

        <option value="Refined the shape addition method in ViewController.java by adding a null check for the selected shape and ensuring shapes are only added on primary mouse button clicks, improving input handling and preventing unintended behavior. Updated SweepGitChanges.xml to include a new commit summary reflecting these changes and maintaining accurate development history." />
        <option value="Updated module integration compatibility by refining shape creation logic and metadata tracking. Modified ViewController.java to pass mouse coordinates to set shape center positions during creation. Updated Shape2DCreator.java to temporarily disable Ellipse shape creation. Adjusted Shape2DCreatorTest.java and Shape1DCreatorTest.java to use updated getter methods (e.g., getShapeWidth, getShapeHeight, getShapeLength) for compatibility with refactored shape classes. Enhanced GhostTextManager_v2.xml with new ghost text metadata entries related to module-info.java errors and developer queries. SweepGitChanges.xml was updated to reflect the latest commit summary and maintain accurate development history." />
        <option value="Implemented and finalized the ShapeCreator factories for 1D and 2D shapes, including full functionality and unit tests. Shape2DCreator.java and Shape1DCreator.java were refactored to provide concrete implementations of the ShapeCreator interface, supporting creation of Rectangle, Ellipse, and Line shapes with configurable stroke and fill colors. ShapeCreator.java was updated with JavaDoc comments to clarify its interface contract. New test classes Shape2DCreatorTest.java and Shape1DCreatorTest.java were added to validate the behavior of the shape factories. ViewController.java was modified to call setCenterX() and setCenterY() on newly created shapes. Metadata files SweepGitChanges.xml and GhostTextManager_v2.xml were updated to reflect the new commit and development activity." />
        <option value="Refactored shape interfaces and implemented the SegmentShape class with corresponding unit tests. The old abstract SegmentShape class was removed and replaced with a concrete implementation in shapes/SegmentShape.java, which extends JavaFX's Line and implements the new Shape1D interface. SegmentShapeTest.java was added to validate its behavior. The Shape1D and Shape2D interfaces were moved to the shapes package and simplified. ShapeInterface was also moved and updated accordingly. Several files were renamed and reorganized into appropriate packages (e.g., UI, factories, fileHandlers) to improve modularity. ViewController.java and DrawingApplication.java were updated to reflect the new package structure. The module-info.java and pom.xml files were modified to export and open the new packages." />
        <option value="Removed an unused import of ScrollPane from ViewController.java to clean up the code and eliminate unnecessary dependencies. Also updated SweepGitChanges.xml to include a new commit summary documenting recent UI refactoring and metadata changes, maintaining accurate version control history." />
