        <option value="Refined the shape addition method in ViewController.java by adding a null check for the selected shape and ensuring shapes are only added on primary mouse button clicks, improving input handling and preventing unintended behavior. Updated SweepGitChanges.xml to include a new commit summary reflecting these changes and maintaining accurate development history." />
        <option value="Updated module integration compatibility by refining shape creation logic and metadata tracking. Modified ViewController.java to pass mouse coordinates to set shape center positions during creation. Updated Shape2DCreator.java to temporarily disable Ellipse shape creation. Adjusted Shape2DCreatorTest.java and Shape1DCreatorTest.java to use updated getter methods (e.g., getShapeWidth, getShapeHeight, getShapeLength) for compatibility with refactored shape classes. Enhanced GhostTextManager_v2.xml with new ghost text metadata entries related to module-info.java errors and developer queries. SweepGitChanges.xml was updated to reflect the latest commit summary and maintain accurate development history." />
        <option value="Implemented and finalized the ShapeCreator factories for 1D and 2D shapes, including full functionality and unit tests. Shape2DCreator.java and Shape1DCreator.java were refactored to provide concrete implementations of the ShapeCreator interface, supporting creation of Rectangle, Ellipse, and Line shapes with configurable stroke and fill colors. ShapeCreator.java was updated with JavaDoc comments to clarify its interface contract. New test classes Shape2DCreatorTest.java and Shape1DCreatorTest.java were added to validate the behavior of the shape factories. ViewController.java was modified to call setCenterX() and setCenterY() on newly created shapes. Metadata files SweepGitChanges.xml and GhostTextManager_v2.xml were updated to reflect the new commit and development activity." />
        <option value="Refactored shape interfaces and implemented the SegmentShape class with corresponding unit tests. The old abstract SegmentShape class was removed and replaced with a concrete implementation in shapes/SegmentShape.java, which extends JavaFX's Line and implements the new Shape1D interface. SegmentShapeTest.java was added to validate its behavior. The Shape1D and Shape2D interfaces were moved to the shapes package and simplified. ShapeInterface was also moved and updated accordingly. Several files were renamed and reorganized into appropriate packages (e.g., UI, factories, fileHandlers) to improve modularity. ViewController.java and DrawingApplication.java were updated to reflect the new package structure. The module-info.java and pom.xml files were modified to export and open the new packages." />
        <option value="Removed an unused import of ScrollPane from ViewController.java to clean up the code and eliminate unnecessary dependencies. Also updated SweepGitChanges.xml to include a new commit summary documenting recent UI refactoring and metadata changes, maintaining accurate version control history." />
        <option value="Refactored the UI layout management by replacing the ScrollPane reference with a direct Pane reference in ViewController.java to simplify shape rendering and interaction. Updated the addShape() method to add shapes directly to the Pane instead of accessing the ScrollPane's content. Also removed an unused Label import. Modified SweepGitChanges.xml to include a new commit summary documenting a related fix to fill color application logic and metadata updates." />
        <option value="Fixed the pickedFillColor() method in ViewController.java to ensure that fill color is only applied to 2D shapes. This was done by adding a type check to confirm the selected shape is an instance of Shape2DCreator before setting the fill color, preventing potential runtime errors for unsupported shape types. Additionally, SweepGitChanges.xml was updated to include a new commit summary documenting the removal of redundant enumerator classes, maintaining accurate version control metadata." />
        <option value="Removed redundant enumerator classes TYPE_1D.java and TYPE_2D.java to eliminate duplication and streamline shape type definitions. These enums were previously used to distinguish between different 1D and 2D shapes (e.g., LINE, RECTANGLE, ELLIPSE) but have now been removed, likely due to their functionality being integrated elsewhere or deemed unnecessary. SweepGitChanges.xml was updated to reflect this change by adding a new commit summary describing the removal of these enums, ensuring accurate version control metadata." />
        <option value="Added toString() method declarations to Shape1D.java and Shape2D.java interfaces to support standardized string representations of shape objects. This change enhances debugging and logging capabilities by ensuring that all implementing classes provide a textual description of their state." />
        <option value="Added enumerations to shape interfaces to define specific shape types. Introduced TYPE_2D enum in Shape2D.java to represent RECTANGLE and ELLIPSE, and TYPE_1D enum in Shape1D.java to represent LINE, enabling clearer type distinction for 1D and 2D shapes. Updated SweepGitChanges.xml to include a new commit summary reflecting recent changes, supporting IDE tooling and version control metadata." />
