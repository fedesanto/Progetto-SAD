        <option value="Implemented a context menu with a &quot;Delete&quot; option for shapes and updated the UI to use buttons for shape selection. Modified `ViewController.java` to add context menu logic, handle right-click events on shapes, and replace shape highlighting with button highlighting. Updated `view.fxml` to replace direct shape elements with buttons containing shape graphics, improving user interaction and visual feedback." />
        <option value="Renamed Visitor pattern method names from Italian to English to improve code clarity and maintain consistency across the codebase. Specifically, the method `visita` was renamed to `visit`, and `accetta` to `accept`. This change affected multiple files: `VisitorShape.java` and `VisitorResize.java` were updated to reflect the new method names in the interface and implementation; `RectangleShape.java`, `EllipseShape.java`, and `SegmentShape.java` were modified to use `accept(visitor)` instead of `accetta(visitor)`; `ShapeInterface.java` was updated to declare `accept(VisitorShape visitor)`; and `SweepGitChanges.xml` was updated to include a new commit summary documenting these changes." />
        <option value="Refactored ViewController.java to improve code readability and maintainability by standardizing spacing and formatting, renaming method parameters for clarity, and ensuring consistent code style. The changes include proper spacing in conditional statements, alignment of Javadoc comments, and renaming the MouseEvent parameter from 'event' to 'e' in one method for consistency." />
        <option value="Implemented the Visitor design pattern to support shape resizing functionality. Added the VisitorShape interface to define visit methods for Shape1D and Shape2D types (VisitorShape.java). Created VisitorResize.java to provide a concrete visitor that opens JavaFX dialogs for resizing shapes with input validation. Updated shape classes (SegmentShape.java, RectangleShape.java, EllipseShape.java) to implement the accetta method, enabling them to accept visitors. Modified ShapeInterface.java to include the accetta method in the interface. Updated ViewController.java to import VisitorResize for future integration. Also updated module-info.java to export and open the new visitors package. Added uiDesigner.xml for UI component definitions and updated SweepGitChanges.xml with new commit summaries." />
        <option value="Updated the product backlog for Sprint 2 by modifying &quot;Product backlog.docx&quot; to reflect the latest planning and prioritization of tasks. Additionally, updated &quot;SweepGitChanges.xml&quot; to include two new commit summaries that document recent changes, including the addition of the class diagram and a minor refactor in ViewController.java. These updates ensure that both the backlog and commit history are aligned with the current state of the project." />

        <option value="Groomed the product backlog for Sprint 2 by updating the &quot;Product backlog.docx&quot; file to reflect the latest planning and prioritization of tasks. Additionally, modified &quot;SweepGitChanges.xml&quot; to include new commit summaries that document recent changes, including the addition of the class diagram and retrospective report, as well as minor refactoring in ViewController.java. These updates ensure that both the backlog and commit history are aligned with the current state of the project." />
        <option value="Groomed the product backlog for Sprint 2 by updating the &quot;Product backlog.docx&quot; file to reflect new or revised backlog items. Additionally, modified &quot;SweepGitChanges.xml&quot; to include two new commit summaries documenting recent additions: the inclusion of the class diagram for Sprint 1 and a minor refactor in ViewController.java. These updates ensure the backlog and commit history are aligned with the current state of the project." />
        <option value="Added the file &quot;Class Diagram Sprint 1.pdf&quot; to the project to document the class structure and relationships defined during Sprint 1. This file serves as a visual representation of the system's design and architecture at this stage of development. Additionally, updated SweepGitChanges.xml to include a new commit summary reflecting the addition of the class diagram. Minor refactoring was also performed in ViewController.java to improve code readability by renaming a method parameter from 'e' to 'event' and updating corresponding references." />
